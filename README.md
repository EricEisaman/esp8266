# ESP8266
A collection of Arduino Skectches for ESP8266.

**Note:** You can develop prototypes or build production devices with either board. The ESP8266-01 production boards have a lower average price and smaller form factor. ESP8266 development boards have a simpler flashing method which can be done solely with a micro-usb cable. Variants of these models may have different voltage tolerances, baud rates, wifi bandwidths, wifi power, and onboard memory.
