###  :gem: blink-led-webserver-connected-to-internet-router.ino

  Devices must be on the same LAN as the ESP8266 and access through local IP printed in serial console.
  
  You must set the SSID and password of your Internet router in the code. :sunglasses:
  
### :gem: blink-led-webserver-standalone.ino
  
  (NO CONNECTION TO EXTERNAL ROUTER)
  Devices must connect directly to the ESP8266 wireless access point then go to http://192.168.4.1/. 
  
  You get to set the SSID and password in the code! :grin:
